# Hello!

This is your very first quarto document

## A section

You can organize it in sections


::: {.grid}

::: {.g-col-4}

First column, 4/12 of the total width

:::

::: {.g-col-8}

Second column, 8/12 of the total width

:::

:::

### A subsection

And subsections too!!

```{r}
3 + 2
```

Here's another code chunk but I don't want you to see my code to obtain @fig-myplot

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-cap: "A plot"
#| fig-cap-location: margin
#| label: fig-myplot
plot(rock$area, rock$peri)
```
